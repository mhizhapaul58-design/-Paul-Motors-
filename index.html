        <p>
            The history of German cars dates back to the late 19th century when
            Karl Benz invented the first gasoline-powered automobile in 1886. This
            groundbreaking invention laid the foundation for the German automotive
            industry, which has since evolved into a global powerhouse known for
            its innovation and quality.
